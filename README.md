## Objective

Qlert aims to revolutionize AI usage by ensuring responsible and ethical adoption through the integration of automatic rule generation and real-time risk assessment mechanisms. By providing administrators with the tools to monitor user interactions and mitigate potential risks, Qlert promotes trust, transparency, and compliance in AI usage within organizations.

## Implementation

### Automatic Rule Generation

Qlert utilizes a Summarizer Language Model (LLM) to automatically generate rules from uploaded PDFs, with provisions for manual rule addition by administrators. These rules are then stored in a Qdrant Vector DB as embeddings, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval. Azure database is then used to store all queries made to LLMs and the the corresponding risk levels of these queries.
Below are some screenshots showcasing different features of Qlert:

### Real-time Risk Assessment

User queries trigger a similarity search on the vector DB to check for risky prompts, while output from LLM models also undergoes a similarity search. Risky prompts exceeding a threshold trigger alerts, with administrators notified via the admin dashboard. Simultaneously, users receive error responses to mitigate potential risks.

### Admin Dashboard

Qlert provides administrators with a comprehensive admin dashboard where they can view users querying risky content, monitor real-time graphical views of risky queries, and assess prompt injection attempts. Admins also have the authority to block user access if necessary.

   pip install -r requirement.txt
   ```

4. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```

5. Run client server:

   ```bash
   npm i
   npm run dev
   ```

6. Open your web browser and navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:3000/](http://127.0.0.1:3000/) to access Qlert.

## Usage

### Automatic Rule Generation

- Upload PDFs to automatically generate rules.
